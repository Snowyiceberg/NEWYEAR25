# NEWYEAR25
A Happy New Year! 2025 in Applesoft Basic. Written on a real IIgs!

How to run: 
1. To run the .BAS or (Basic) program you will need an Apple II emulator or the real deal Apple IIgs.
On Windows I use AppleWin, a emulation program that can be found here. https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin/
2. Copy all the code exactly as written from Github window.
3. Open AppleWin program > Press the Apple Key on right side of the window, it will beep and load the Basic interpretor prompt (]).
4. On your keyboard hold down Shift + Insert. It will then begin automatically copying all 432 lines of code into the prompt.
5. When the ] prompt returns type GR for lowres graphics mode. Then type RUN.

You should now be able to see the program running. Enjoy!
